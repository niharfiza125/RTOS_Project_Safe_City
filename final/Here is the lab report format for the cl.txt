Title: AI-Based Priority Classification Client System

Abstract:
This report presents the implementation of a client-side system that captures images via a webcam, processes them using a pre-trained TensorFlow model, predicts the class based on the captured image, and sends the priority information to a server. The system utilizes socket communication to interact with the server, demonstrating a practical application of AI and networking in real-time image processing.

1. Introduction:

1.1 Background:
The integration of AI and networking has opened new avenues for real-time applications, including image recognition and priority-based task management. This project aims to implement a client-side system that captures images, processes them using a machine learning model, and communicates the results to a server for further action.

1.2 Objectives:
- To capture images from a webcam.
- To process the captured images using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.
- To predict the class of the captured image and determine the priority.
- To send the priority information to a server via socket communication.

2. System Architecture:

2.1 Block Diagram:
A block diagram representing the system architecture is shown below:

    F --> G[Server];
```

2.2 Description:
- Webcam: Captures live images.
- Image Capture: Grabs frames from the webcam.
- Image Preprocessing: Resizes and normalizes the captured images.
- Model Prediction: Uses a TensorFlow model to predict the class of the image.
- Priority Determination: Determines the priority based on the predicted class.
- Socket Communication: Sends the priority information to the server.
- Server: Receives and processes the priority information.

3. Implementation:

3.1 Code Snippets:

3.1.1 Main Client Code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
from keras.models import load_model
import cv2  # Ensure you have opencv-python installed
import numpy as np
import os
import socket
import sys
import time
from socket_file import socket_func, error

np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)

def model_func(sock: socket):
    model_path = "./model.savedmodel/"
    if not os.path.exists(model_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Model file '{model_path}' not found. Please ensure the file is in the correct location.")
    model = tf.saved_model.load("model.savedModel")
    labels_path = "labels.txt"
    if not os.path.exists(labels_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Labels file '{labels_path}' not found. Please ensure the file is in the correct location.")
    class_names = open(labels_path, "r").readlines()
    camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
    while True:
        ret, image = camera.read()
        if not ret:
            print("Failed to grab frame")
            continue
        image_resized = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
        cv2.imshow("Webcam Image", image_resized)
        image_array = np.asarray(image_resized, dtype=np.float32).reshape(1, 224, 224, 3)
        image_normalized = (image_array / 127.5) - 1
        prediction = model(image_normalized)
        index = np.argmax(prediction)
        class_name = class_names[index].strip()
        confidence_score = prediction[0][index]
        print(f"Class: {class_name} Confidence Score: {confidence_score:.2%}")
        keyboard_input = cv2.waitKey(1)
        if keyboard_input == 27:
            break
        buffer = class_name
        if buffer not in ["1", "2"]:
            buffer = "0"
        try:
            sock.sendall(buffer.encode())
            time.sleep(0.25)
        except socket.error as err:
            error(f"Error writing to socket: {err}")
    camera.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    sock.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sock = socket_func()
    model_func(sock=sock)
```

3.1.2 Socket File Code (`socket_file.py`):
```python
import socket
import sys

def error(msg):
    print(f"Error: {msg}")
    sys.exit(1)

def socket_func() -> socket:
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print(f"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} <hostname> <port>")
        sys.exit(1)
    hostname = sys.argv[1]
    portno = int(sys.argv[2])
    try:
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    except socket.error as err:
        error(f"Error opening socket: {err}")
    try:
        server_ip = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)
    except socket.error as err:
        error(f"Error, no such host: {err}")
    server_addr = (server_ip, portno)
    try:
        sock.connect(server_addr)
    except socket.error as err:
        error(f"Error connecting: {err}")
    return sock
```

4. Results and Discussion:

4.1 Results:
The system successfully captures images from the webcam, processes them, and predicts the class using the TensorFlow model. The predicted class is then converted to a priority value and sent to the server using socket communication.

4.2 Discussion:
The implementation demonstrates a practical application of AI and networking in real-time image processing. The system can be further enhanced by integrating more complex models and improving the user interface.

5. Conclusion:
This project successfully implemented a client-side system that captures, processes, and classifies images in real-time, sending priority information to a server. The integration of AI and socket communication showcases the potential for developing advanced real-time applications.

6. Future Work:
- Integrate more sophisticated machine learning models.
- Enhance the user interface for better user experience.
- Implement additional functionalities such as real-time alerts based on classification results.
